1.Characteristics of big data:
                         * Big data could be found in three forms:

                           Structured
                           Unstructured
                           Semi-structured

                         *3 v's of big data
                          =volume-big data process on large volume of data that cannot be 
                                 in a single existing node
                          =variety-big data generally is a large sum of heterogeneous data which 
                                  can be structured, unstructured or semi structured
                                  structured data such as tables,it is mostly unstructured data such 
                                  as audio,video,ect.
                          =velocity-it refers to the speed at which the data is generated 
                                    from the source and there is a necessity to deals with such type 
                                    the data flow without any lag.
                          =varacity –it refers to the consistency and trustworthyness of data interms of accuracy.
                          =value -it refers to the value that the data could yield.

2. Difference between scale-out versus scale-up:


    *scaling up:when there is a shortage of resources scaling up is empowerin a single node
                with additional resources such as by enhancing ram or upgrading memory storage.
    
    *Scaling out:the process of sharing the work load among a number of nodes in a cluster inorder to
                 attain max effiency and to manage device failure threats.

3.Solutions to handle big data:there are a number of tools been developed to handle bigdata
the following are some of them
*hadoop
*oracle
*gfs
*spark
